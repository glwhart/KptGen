# KptGen
## K-point generation and symmetry folding

This code generates kpoint grids for DFT codes. Any k-point generating vectors that are compatible with the reciprocal lattice are allowed. The full k-point list can be generated, or a symmetry-reduced set (with weights) can be generated.

This code relies on a symmetry library: https://github.com/msg-byu/symlib
